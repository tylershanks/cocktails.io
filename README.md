### What tools were used?

This project uses JavaScript, React, Node, Express, MondoDB, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, RESTful APIs, Redux, Google OAuth, Webpack, MaterialUI


### What was your motivation?

I was initially motivated by the lack of fast and efficient recipe lookup tools for cocktails. I recently began working as a bartender and memorizing all of the common drink recipes was a daunting task. After spending too much time behind the bar trying to find the exact ingredients on inefficient websites or scrolling through a very long note on my phone, I decided I would create my own solution.

I also did not fully understand fullstack applications from start to finish and creating this project gave me a way to really learn it all. From React to Express and Node, I was able to learn a ton more about linking front end, user inputed data to my database. I was able to learn how to allow users to create, read, update, and delete their own recipes. I learned how to efficiently give users access to many common recipes and teach them how to make these drinks with no extraneous information.

Learning how to manage user info and implement Google OAuth was also a big part of this project for me. This allows users to create their own recipes that only they can see while also keeping access to the publicly available drinks that I manually entered.

This application is also fully mobile responsive. That responsiveness was a driving factor in this project as well. This is ultimately an application that I want to use at my job on a nightly basis. So having this app fully useable on a mobile device was something that I needed to make happen.


### What makes your project stand out?

This project stands out from the rest of mine because it is the first completely fullstack app that I created. It goes beyond just showing an understanding of the tools and frameworks that I used. There is a legitimate problem that is solved because of this app and it is something that I use on a daily basis. Cocktails.io is very useful during my job as a bartender, but it is also really helpful when I am hanging out with friends. If we are making drinks, there is always something new for someone to try. This app enables all of this to happen, and it has had the biggest impact on my life outside of programming than any other project I made.


### What did you learn?

Creating this project taught me a lot about the process of developing a full stack app from front to back. Everything from connecting the front end to the back end to allow users to see what is necessary in specific places to allowing users to create their own entries into the database. I also learned how to use Google OAuth with this project as well. Google OAuth enables certain features with its unique user ID's that allow users to create and see their own recipes. It also allows me to go in and look at what users have created and potentially allow them to be pushed onto the public list. This project goes beyond the other projects I have made up to this point and I really feel as though I made a lot of big steps in my software development journey.


### What problem does it solve?

To give more context to this project, understanding my initial problem will help. As mentioned before, I recently began working as a bartender. There are thousands of drinks in the world, with new ones being created every day. Luckily, in a typical bar setting, people stick to the same 100 or so drinks. That is still a lot! I took a bartending class that taught many of the most common drinks, but that was not enough. I always hear of new drinks being ordered or different ways to make a certain drink. Some of those I now make very often, and some of those drinks I have not made since hearing about them the one time. Instead of committing every drink I've ever heard of to memory, I began writing some down on the Notes app on my phone.

The Notes app was good because it offered a very quick solution. If there was a drink that I did not know the ingredients of but I had it written down in the Notes app, I could easily open the note and find the exact information I was looking for. The problem is that once the note started getting too long, it became very cumbersome to find that one specific drink I was looking for.

The other option is Google. I could search for a drink on the internet and find hundreds of recipes for one specific drink. The main problem for this is that every website that comes up towards the top of a Google search is your typical recipe website. Every drink has its own article attached that precedes the recipe itself. It takes precious time to scroll through the entire page to eventually find the ingredients you need as well as how much of each ingredient. Sometimes the amounts are not even included! If you are behind a bar when you are looking this up, that takes up a lot of extra time while a customer is watching you, wondering why you're on your phone instead of making a drink! You could go through 2 or 3 recipe websites before you find a recipe that actually works.


Cocktails.io solves both of these problems. All of the publicly available drinks are added or verified by real bartenders so you can trust those initial recipes. If you don't like them, you can create an account and add your own recipes! All of the information will be displayed in a consistent manner, making it easy to read on the fly. There is no extraneous information either, so once you see the drink you are looking for, you can just click on it and follow the ingredient list.

The search feature allows you to quickly search and filter specific drinks as well. Even if there are thousands of drinks on the website, you can narrow it down with a very quick search. The search feature is very broad as well, so if someone asks you to make them a drink with rum, you can just search rum and any drink with rum in it will appear.

Quick and easy searches, readability, and the ability to add your own drinks is exactly what I wanted Cocktails.io to be. With this application also being fully mobile responsive, using it behind a bar on your smartphone could not be easier.
